            <h1>about nobody</h1>
            <p>When I was alone at home one day, I was more excited than being afraid. My parents had gone for an invitation and had left me behind as I was not keen in going with them. I was feeling free like a bird and very independent for the first time in my life. I had some snacks that my mother had prepared along with a glass of hot chocolate, which is my favourite. I then sank into the couch and began reading one of my favourite stories of the Hardy Boys.

                I read the story book for about an hour and then decided to take a break. It was around 6:30 p.m. by then. My favourite television programme would begin at 7:00 p.m.; although my mother instructed me on the 'dos and don'ts of watching television. Any way for about another two hours I would be the master of my life! I peeped out of the window. There was the full moon shining brightly on the streets. Some children were playing badminton on a cool wintry night. A cool and fresh gust of wind was blowing through the window.
                
                I went to the kitchen and then to the refrigerator to find something to munch on. Finding something to eat, I returned to the hall room where I became a couch potato and watched my favourite Television programme. It was around 7:30 p.m. and I was sitting comfortably on the couch, when the lights went off. It was a power cut. Suddenly I found myself in darkness. What bad luck, I thought to myself. I went to find the emergency light to get rid of the darkness around me. I was feeling a bit afraid in the dark, but was finding the whole episode more like some sort of an adventure.
